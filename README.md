# Map-Editor
This project does not have an official name, hence the generic title of this project.

Map-Editor was originally developed as a tool for creating and editing levels for a puzzle game I was working on called "FIXED". The map editor was implemented in such a way that the code can be easily changed to handle level editing for any future games.

# The choice of language
With C\# I had better tools for quickly creating and managing GUI code, allowing me to focus more on the function of the program. This language also has automatic memory management and it is fairly similar to Java, which for me it meant the barrier to entry was low.
