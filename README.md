# Map-Editor
This project does not have an official name, hence the generic title of this project.

Map-Editor was originally developed as a tool for creating and editing levels for a puzzle game I was working on called "FIXED". The map editor was implemented in such a way that the code can be easily changed to handle level editing for any future games.
